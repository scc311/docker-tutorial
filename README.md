# Docker Tutorial 🐳

This will cover the basics of using Docker from the command line, highlighting a few use cases where Docker can be useful.

These have been tested on Docker for MacOS, but should have no issues on Docker for Linux. Docker for Windows 10 should be set to run linux containers! And you Windows 10 install should have been updated after May 2020.

## Hello World

This will simply cover how to build and run containers from the command line. Also covering some of the Dockerfile spec.

See [here](./1.%20Hello%20World).

## Web Server

This will show how to use port mapping in Docker, and also cover volume mounting.

See [here](./2.%20Web%20Server).

## Environment Variables

This will just cover the use of environment variables.

See [here]().

## Use Case: Minecraft Servers

This will cover how to quickly run a Minecraft server using Docker. To represent how docker can be best used, this will run 2 Minecraft servers, each a different server version. 

> This is for the Java version of Minecraft

See [here]().

## Use Case: 2 Java Versions

This shows how Docker can be used to avoid installing multiple versioned runtimes on your local machine, making code that uses different versions (in this case, of Java), easier to build and run.

See [here]().

## Use Case: Java RMI Coursework

This shows how you can use Docker for your coursework, showing the calculator example from Moodle.

See [here]().
